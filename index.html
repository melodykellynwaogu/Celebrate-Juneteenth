	    <h2>What is Juneteenth?</h2>
		<p>
		    Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in the United States.
			On June 19, 1865, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the freedom of enslaved people.
			Today, Juneteenth is celebrated nationwide with family gatherings, parades, readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, and reflections on culture, resilience, and ongoing freedom,
            and the traditional use of red foods — all honoring resilience, freedom, and community.
			As a symbol of perseverance and progress, Juneteenth serves not only as a commemoration but also as a reminder to continue advancing justice, civic engagement, and historical awareness.
